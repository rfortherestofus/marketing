```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```


Hook (why this is a good idea, see above)

## Step 1: Get hold of the colours (client provided these ones, but otherwise colorpicker is a useful website)


## Step 2: Play around with them using dummy data (very quick note on why I like palmerpenguins), see how they balance with each other (in our case, the green was too bright and needed to be toned down to work in dataviz)


## Step 3: Create color/fill scales (with easy to follow code example)


## Step 4: Put it all through colorblindr to see what it looks like and tweak accordingly


## Step 5: Determine colours for the NAs and for Text as an extra nice touch

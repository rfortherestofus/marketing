We're often asked by clients to make maps, and 9 out of 10 times they ask us to make heat maps. They're more technically called choropleth, but heat maps are incredibly useful and easy to understand maps.

At their simplest, heat maps require two things:

- Shapefiles for the regions of interest. Your regions might be countries, states or other country subdivisions like census tracts.

- A value for each region of interest. This could be a numeric value (like population) or it could be a categorical variable like the most popular streaming service in a state.

I really love mapping with R because it's fairly simple to start off and we can build really beautiful static and interactive maps. Our [mapping with R course](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/mapping/) will take you through all the steps required to build choropleth. But let me take you through the basic steps so you know what's involved.

## Shapefiles and the {sf} package

In the video below I'm going to introduce the [{sf}](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package which is the backbone of most mapping things you'll do with R. I'll use the [{tidycensus}](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) package to obtain the population for all US states from the US Census. The great thing about {sf} datasets is can use them [inside of a tidyverse workflow](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/06/what-is-a-tidyverse-centric-approach/) to extract just the contiguous United States.

<!--- INSERT VIDEO tidycensus and sf !--->

Here's the code that I wrote in the video:

```{r}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)

us_state_pop <- get_acs(
  geography = "state", 
  year = 2019,
  variables = c("population" = "B01001_001"), 
  geometry = TRUE)

us_state_pop %>% 
  filter(NAME == "Florida")

non_contiguous_regions <- c("Alaska", "Hawaii", "Rhode Island", "Puerto Rico")

us_contiguous <- us_state_pop %>% 
  filter(!NAME %in% non_contiguous_regions)
```

If you're working with other regions you'll need to obtain shapefiles and read them into R using read_sf() from {sf}, which I cover in the introduction to [Mapping with R](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/mapping/).


## Quickly view map data with {maview}

It's absolutely crucial when working with map data to be able to see your data (the map) - and that's exactly what the {mapview} package is for. It will take any geospatial dataset, whether it's from {sf}, {sp}, {raster}, {stars} and many others and ... just visualise it.

<!--- INSERT VIDEO mapview !--->

Here's all the code necessary to create a choropleth with {mapview}.

```{r}
us_contiguous %>% 
  mapview(zcol = "estimate")
```

This is literally as far as I ever go with {mapview}. It's job is to quickly visualise your map data, and that's it. My next step would be to decide between making a static map with {ggplot2} and an interactive one with {leaflet}

## Static maps with {ggplot2}

The {ggplot2} packages is an incredibly powerful data visualisation tool that is able to visualise {sf} datasets. This means that we can create choropleth (and other!) maps using our existing {ggplot2} knowledge. In the video below I'll show how to make this map

.pull-left[
```{r}
us_contiguous %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = estimate)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(label = number_format(scale = 1E-6, suffix = " Million"),
                       name = "") +
  labs(title = "State population for the contiguous US",
       subtitle = "Data: ACS Survey") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.key.width = unit(3, "cm"))
```

]

.pull-right[
<!--- INSERT VIDEO ggplot2 !--->
]

Here's the code I used to create the map:

```{r}
us_contiguous %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = estimate)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(label = number_format(scale = 1E-6, suffix = " Million"),
                       name = "") +
  labs(title = "State population for the contiguous US",
       subtitle = "Data: ACS Survey") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.key.width = unit(3, "cm"))
```


There's a lot more we could do to beautify this heat map, but I wanted to show you the bare bones basics.

## Interactive maps with {leaflet}

{ggplot2} is fine if you're making a map you need to print. But if you're going to publish your map to the web... why not make an interactive heat map with the {leaflet} package?

.pull-left[
<img src='leaflet-heat-map.png'/>

]

.pull-right[
<!--- INSERT VIDEO leaflet !--->
]

It takes a little bit more effort to create a {leaflet} map as I needed to create a user-defined function for the popup, but it's worth it. Interactivity allows your readers to explore and really understand what's shown in the heat map. Here's the exact code I showed in the video.

```{r}
pal_state_pop <- colorNumeric("viridis", us_contiguous$estimate)

label_state <- function(state, pop){
  str_glue("{state} with population of {pop}")
}

us_contiguous %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addPolygons(weight = 1,
              color = "white",
              fillColor = ~pal_state_pop(estimate),
              fillOpacity = 1,
              popup = ~label_state(NAME, estimate)) %>% 
  addLegend(pal = pal_state_pop,
            values = ~estimate,
            opacity = 1)
```

## Going further with heat maps

Small multiples is an excellent data visualisation technique for comparing how a variable varies across a range of categories. It's particularly powerful when working with heat maps, as shown in the map below which I built with {ggplot2} and show you how to build in our [Mapping with R course](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/mapping/).

```{r}
london_sf <- read_sf("data/london_boroughs")

education_data <- read_csv("data/age-when-completed-education.csv")

london_education_sf <- london_sf %>% 
  left_join(education_data,
            by = c("lad11nm" = "area")) %>% 
  group_by(lad11nm) %>% 
  mutate(value = value / sum(value)) 

# ==== data viz ====


order_age_groups <- c("Still in education",
                      "16 or under",
                      "17-19",
                      "20-23",
                      "24+")


london_education_sf %>% 
  mutate(age_group = fct_relevel(age_group, order_age_groups)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = value,
              shape = "City of London"),
          color = "white",
          size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = "pink",
                       labels = scales::percent_format(),
                       name = "% of population") +
  facet_wrap(~age_group) +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = "pink"), order = 2, title = NULL),
         fill = guide_colorbar(order = 1,
                               barwidth = grid::unit(10, "cm"))) +
  labs(title = "At what age do Londoners leave education?") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "top")
```
